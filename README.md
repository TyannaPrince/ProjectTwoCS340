Apply database systems concepts and principles in the development of a client/server application
Develop client-side code that interfaces with databases
Scenario
You work for Global Rain, a software engineering company that specializes in custom software design and development. Your team has been assigned to work on a project for an innovative international rescue-animal training company, Grazioso Salvare. You have been made the lead developer on this project.

As part of its work, Grazioso Salvare identifies dogs that are good candidates for search-and-rescue training. When trained, these dogs are able to find and help to rescue humans or other animals, often in life-threatening conditions. To help identify dogs for training, Grazioso Salvare has reached an agreement with a non-profit agency that operates five animal shelters in the region around Austin, Texas. This non-profit agency will provide Grazioso Salvare with data from their shelters.

In meeting with the client, you have discovered that they look for certain profiles in dogs to train. For example, search-and-rescue training is generally more effective for dogs that are no more than two years old. Additionally, different breeds of dogs are proficient at different types of rescue, such as water rescue, mountain or wilderness rescue, locating humans after a disaster, or finding a specific human by tracking their scent.

Grazioso Salvare is seeking a software application that can work with existing data from the animal shelters to identify and categorize available dogs. Global Rain has contracted for a full stack development of this application, including a database and a client-facing web application dashboard through which users at Grazioso Salvare will access the database.

In the initial phases of this development, you developed a database and a Python module enabling CRUD functionality for MongoDB. For Project Two, you will complete the development of this project by coding the dashboard and the database interface logic. This will include dashboard attributes. The dashboard must be a user-friendly, intuitive interface that will reduce user errors and training time.

Additionally, Grazioso Salvare has requested that the code for this project be open source and accessible on GitHub, so that it may be used and adapted by similar organizations. To that end, they have asked that you also create a README file that documents and provides instructions for reproducing the project.
